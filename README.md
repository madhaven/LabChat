# LanChat

Python script/program intended for communicating with the systems in a LAN/WLAN connection.
It uses socket programming done in python to connect to each other.

the LanChat.py file is a CLI version of the project and is pretty neat for all its worth.
the LanChat.pyw still needs some debugging. Although it could be used pretty well either way as of now.

On running either of the LanChat scripts, the user will be prompted to either enter the ip of a master system, or to set the user's own system as the master.
On pressing enter, the user's system will act as a master. An ip will be fetched on the system which can be used by other users to connect to the master.
