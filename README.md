# LanChat

so this program is intended for communicating with the systems in a LAN/WLAN connection.
It uses socket programming done in python to connect to each other.
The server must be selected first... followed by clients

the socks.py file is a CLI version of the project and is pretty neat for all its worth.
the gui.py file is still under construction(you cannot host chat-groups yet). Although, It could be used to connect to already existing chat-groups started with the socks.py program.
