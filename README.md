# LanChat

so this program is intended for communicating with the systems in a LAN/WLAN connection.
It uses socket programming done in python to connect to each other.
The master must be initiated first... Clients could join by connecting to the ip of the master

the LanChat.py file is a CLI version of the project and is pretty neat for all its worth.
the LanChat.pyw still needs some debugging. Although it could be used pretty well either way as of now.
